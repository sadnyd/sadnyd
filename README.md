👋 Hi, I’m Devayan! I'm exploring the exciting world of Machine Learning and Data Science. With strong foundations in Java and Python, I enjoy building end-to-end projects—from training ML models to deploying full-stack applications.

Curiosity drives me to experiment with innovative solutions, whether it’s gesture-controlled interfaces, agentic AIs, MCP servers, image recognition models, or AI-powered tools. I love solving complex problems, learning cutting-edge technologies, and turning ideas into practical digital experiences.
